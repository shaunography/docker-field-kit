# docker-field-kit
Docker based field kit, inspired by Trusted Sec's [The PenTesters Framework (PTF)](https://github.com/trustedsec/ptf).

## usage
To install a docker image/tool, change into the respective directory for that tool, run `bash build.sh`. then source or add the .bash_aliases file to your .bashrc, or run the update aliases script in the root of repo to cat all .bash_aliases files into ~/.bash_aliases.

Some tools dont require building and pull from dockerhub, for those you just need to add the alias.
